# 
# ## Introduction
# 

# A company's stock share is a piece of the company more precisely:
# <p><b>A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownershipÂ of a fraction of aÂ corporation. This
# entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation'sÂ assetsÂ and profits equal to how much stock they own.Â Units of stock are called "shares." [1]</p></b>
# 
# An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,the investor with incur a loss.Â Â Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day the stock tickerÂ is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the variousÂ stockÂ market exchanges. 
# <p>You are a data scientist working for a hedge fund; it's your job to determine any suspicious stock activity. In this lab you will extract stock data using a Python library. We will use the <coode>yfinance</code> library, it allows us to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe. You will use the lab to extract.</p>

# ### Using the yfinance Library to extract stock data

# Using the `Ticker` module we can create an object that will allow us to access functions to extract data. To do this we need to provide the ticker symbol for the stock, here the company is Apple and the ticker symbol is `AAPL`.
